# Nuwa AI Client

A local-first AI chat client implemented for [Nuwa AI](https://nuwa.dev/) that enables users to create, share, and interact with Caps. 

| Caps (i.e. capability) are mini-apps in Nuwa AI, the minimium functional AI unit. Cap is designed to be an abstraction of AI models and agents. Currently it is the composation of Prompt, Model and MCP Servers.
